# Markdown Notes

Markdown Notes is a simple web app that allows a user to keep track of a list of markdown-styled notes. Once an account has been created the user can add notes, edit notes, remove notes, and edit his/her account. The idea came from [this](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository. I created this site because it seemed like a good starting place to expand my understanding of how to build a full stack application with MERN.
